SAMOP Abstract

Next generation platform for implementing fast gates in ion trap quantum computation

Scalable trapped-ion quantum computation relies on the development of
high-fidelity fast entangling gates in a many ion
crystal. Conventional geometric phase gates either suffer from
scattering errors or off-resonant carrier excitations. A potential
route to achieve fast entanglement is creating a standing wave which
can suppress the unwanted carrier coupling [Mundt 2003].

We present the roadmap to our next-generation platform tailored for
fast gates in the ~1us regime where gate speeds become comparable to
the secular trap frequency. The quadrupole transitions between S1/2
and D5/2 levels in Calcium 40 will be driven to perform
Molmer-Sorenson gates with a standing wave rather than a typical
travelling wave. The off-resonant carrier excitation may be strongly
suppressed by placing ions at the nodes of the optical lattice. This
new platform has scope for a multi-ion chain and a corresponding array
of optical lattices which each address a single ion. The lattice array
is created by a set of counter-propagating beams which are tightly
focused by a symmetric setup of high-NA lenses. Control of the optical
phase at the ion site will be achieved by actively stabilising the
counter-propagating beam interferometer and feedbacking on the ion
signal.
